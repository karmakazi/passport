## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **For Local Development (HTTP):**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Access at: [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002)

3. **For Local Development with HTTPS (Required for iOS Camera):**
   
   First-time setup:
   ```bash
   # Install mkcert
   brew install mkcert
   
   # Install local CA
   mkcert -install
   
   # Generate certificates (replace IP with your network IP)
   cd .cert
   mkcert localhost YOUR_NETWORK_IP 127.0.0.1 ::1
   cd ..
   ```
   
   Create `.env.local` file:
   ```
   USE_HTTPS=true
   PORT=3002
   ```
   
   Run with HTTPS:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:https
   ```
   Access at: [https://localhost:3002](https://localhost:3002)

4. **For Production (Vercel):**
   The app automatically detects it's running on Vercel and uses the production domain with HTTPS. Just deploy and it works!

## 📖 How to Use

### For Testing/Demo:

#### Desktop Testing:

1. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Visit the Demo Page** - Navigate to `http://localhost:3002/demo`

3. **Desktop Simulation:**
   - Use the "Quick Select" buttons on the scan page
   - Or use manual entry with location IDs: `loc1`, `loc2`, `loc3`, etc.

#### Mobile Testing (Recommended):

1. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Note the network URL shown (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:3002`)

2. **Connect your phone:**
   - Make sure your phone and laptop are on the same WiFi network
   - Visit `/demo` on your laptop
   - Scan the "Connect from Your Phone" QR code with your phone's camera
   - The app will open on your phone

3. **Scan Business QR Codes:**
   - On your phone, tap "Scan QR Code"

### For Production Deployment:

1. **Replace QR Code Simulation:**
   - Integrate a real QR code scanner library (e.g., `html5-qrcode`, `react-qr-reader`)
   - Replace the demo scanning in `/app/scan/page.tsx`

2. **Add Backend:**
   - Connect to a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
   - Store user data and contest entries
   - Implement authentication if needed

3. **Customize Locations:**
   - Edit `/lib/locations.ts` to add your participating businesses
   - Update icons, names, addresses, and descriptions

4. **Update Prizes:**
   - Modify contest details in `/app/contest/page.tsx`
   - Adjust prize information to match your campaign

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors

Edit `tailwind.config.ts` to customize the color scheme:

```typescript
colors: {
  primary: { ... },  // Main brand color
  accent: { ... },   // Secondary brand color
}
```

### Locations

Edit `lib/locations.ts` to add/remove locations:

```typescript
export const LOCATIONS: Location[] = [
  {
    id: 'loc1',
    name: 'Your Business Name',
    address: '123 Main St, Richmond Hill',
    description: 'Description of the business',
    imageUrl: '/images/locations/your-business.jpg',
  },
  // Add more locations...
]
```

### Replacing Placeholder Images

The app currently uses SVG placeholders for location images. To replace them with actual photos:

1. Take high-quality photos of each business (landscape orientation, 16:9 ratio recommended)
2. Optimize images for web (recommended: 800x450px, JPEG format, compressed)
3. Place images in `public/images/locations/`
4. Update the `imageUrl` in `lib/locations.ts` to point to your images
5. Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP

Example:
```typescript
imageUrl: '/images/locations/downtown-coffee.jpg',
```

### Animations

Customize animations in `tailwind.config.ts`:

```typescript
animation: {
  'fade-in': 'fadeIn 0.5s ease-in',
  'slide-up': 'slideUp 0.5s ease-out',
  'stamp': 'stamp 0.6s cubic-bezier(0.36, 0, 0.66, -0.56)',
  'bounce-in': 'bounceIn 0.6s cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55)',
}
```

## 🔧 Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Import your repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and deploy
5. Your app will have HTTPS automatically!

The app is environment-aware:
- **Local Development**: Uses network IP detection for phone testing
- **Production (Vercel)**: Uses your Vercel domain automatically

### Build Locally

```bash
# Create optimized production build
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## 📱 Progressive Web App (PWA)

To make this a PWA that users can install on their phones:

1. Add a manifest file at `public/manifest.json`
2. Add service worker for offline support
3. Add meta tags for app icons in `app/layout.tsx`
